## TODO 

# Technical Debt

* review TODOs in code.

# New Capabilities

* Need ability to expose a URL that can send back all the JS as one single file. Having multiple files is good for development, but for production we need to send one JS file, and also minify it eventually.

* Add Spring profiles for DEV and PROD at minimum.
